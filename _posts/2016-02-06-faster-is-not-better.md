# [Faster is not better][0]

Sometimes the shortest way to good results is taking the time without looking for the shortcuts.

This might seem counter-intuitive in the world of constant hacking and it's easy to feel pressured.

After all, how can you tell you'll get something equally valuable in return as a result?

You can't. There's no guarantee and it's only natural to feel anxious. It's possible to recover the lost money but lost time is something you can never get back.

And that's exactly why it matters. Taking the time is possibly one of more honest ways of showing you care.

It doesn't take a lot, to make a difference. But it does take time.
